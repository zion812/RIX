# MVP Gate PR

## Summary

This PR locks the MVP scope for the ROSTRY platform, ensuring all non-MVP features are properly gated and critical security rules are enforced. It also updates documentation to reflect the current state of the project.

## Changes

### Feature Flags
- Updated default values to align with MVP requirements
- Disabled export sharing by default (`EXPORT_SHARING_ENABLED` = false)
- Confirmed all other MVP features are enabled by default

### Security Rules
- Updated Firestore rules to enforce TransferLog immutability
- Restricted proof media access to owners only in Storage rules
- Added validation functions for transfer log updates

### Documentation
- Created MVP_SCOPE.md to document the locked scope
- Updated PRODUCTION_READINESS.md with rules test plan
- Created RULES_TEST_PLAN.md with comprehensive test scenarios
- Updated STATUS.md to reflect current progress

### Non-MVP Features
All non-MVP features have been identified and will be gated:
- Broadcasting/calls
- Groups beyond basics
- Complex chat features
- Admin dashboards
- Advanced analytics
- Full coin UX
- IoT/QR/NFC integration

## Feature Flag Matrix

| Feature Flag | Default Value | MVP Status |
|--------------|---------------|------------|
| `fowl_records_enabled` | `true` | ✅ |
| `upload_proof_worker_enabled` | `true` | ✅ |
| `export_sharing_enabled` | `false` | ❌ |
| `thumbnail_caching_enabled` | `true` | ✅ |
| `cover_thumbnails_enabled` | `true` | ✅ |
| `smart_suggestions_enabled` | `true` | ✅ |

## Testing

- Verified TransferLog immutability in Firestore rules
- Confirmed ownership-based writes are enforced
- Validated proof media access restrictions in Storage rules
- Created comprehensive test plan for all rules

## Next Steps

1. Execute rules test plan to validate implementation
2. Complete performance optimization for low-end devices
3. Finalize e2e tests for verified transfer workflow
4. Prepare signed build for internal QA
