## 🔐 Security Implementation

### Firestore Rules
- ✅ Ownership-based writes enforced
- ✅ Immutable TransferLog (no edits post VERIFIED/REJECTED)
- ✅ Schema validation for all core entities
- ✅ Tier-based access control

### Storage Rules
- ✅ Proof media rules scoped to owners

- ✅ Size and type validation for all uploads

### Rules Test Plan

#### Firestore Rules Tests
1. **Transfer Log Immutability Test**
   - Create a transfer log with status PENDING
   - Attempt to update when status is PENDING (should succeed)
   - Update status to VERIFIED
   - Attempt to update when status is VERIFIED (should fail)
   - Update status to REJECTED
   - Attempt to update when status is REJECTED (should fail)

2. **Ownership-based Write Tests**
   - User A creates a fowl
   - User B attempts to update the fowl (should fail)
   - User A updates the fowl (should succeed)
   - Admin attempts to update the fowl (should succeed)

3. **Schema Validation Tests**
   - Attempt to create fowl without required fields (should fail)
   - Attempt to create fowl with all required fields (should succeed)
   - Attempt to create marketplace listing without required fields (should fail)

#### Storage Rules Tests
1. **Proof Media Access Tests**
   - Owner uploads proof media (should succeed)
   - Owner reads proof media (should succeed)
   - Other user attempts to read proof media (should fail)
   - Other user attempts to upload proof media (should fail)

2. **Thumbnail Access Tests**
   - Owner uploads thumbnail (should succeed)
   - Owner reads thumbnail (should succeed)
   - Other user attempts to read thumbnail (should fail)

3. **Export Security Tests**
   - Owner reads export (should succeed if export sharing enabled)
   - Other user attempts to read export (should fail)
   - Any user attempts to write export (should fail)
