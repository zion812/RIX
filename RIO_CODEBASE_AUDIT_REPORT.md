## Recent Codebase Audit Findings (2025-08-16)

**Positive Aspects:**
- ✅ Modern architecture with Jetpack Compose and Hilt
- ✅ Good module separation and organization
- ✅ Comprehensive Firebase integration
- ✅ Good test coverage for core components

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. Database Implementation: Core database modules are empty and need to be completed
2. Feature Module Completeness: Several feature modules have incomplete implementations
3. Dependency Management: Some Hilt dependencies are commented out and need re-enabling
4. Security: Debug signing configuration should be removed from production builds
5. Documentation: Several documentation files need updates to reflect current implementation status

## Recommendations
1. Prioritize completion of database modules to enable full offline functionality
2. Re-enable Hilt dependencies in feature modules
3. Implement repository pattern consistently across data module
4. Complete implementation of key feature modules (marketplace, fowl)
5. Update all documentation to accurately reflect current implementation status
