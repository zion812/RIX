# RIO Production Launch Assessment – Codebase Verification Report

## Section A: Executive Summary

**Overall Verdict:**  
**Partial Match** – The RIO codebase implements most core claims from the production report, but several modules are disabled, and some critical features (especially in payments, marketplace, and DI) are incomplete or only partially enforced.

**Top 5 Divergences (with Impact & Severity):**
1. **Module Disabling in Production**  
   - *Impact*: Many core and feature modules (database, payment, network, sync, media, marketplace, fowl, familytree, chat, user) are commented out in `settings.gradle.kts` and not included in builds.  
   - *Severity*: Critical – prevents full feature delivery and undermines modular architecture claims.

2. **Dependency Injection (DI) and Hilt Usage**  
   - *Impact*: Hilt and Kapt are disabled in several modules (`core/database`, `features/fowl`, etc.), breaking DI and scoping guarantees.  
   - *Severity*: High – affects testability, maintainability, and runtime stability.

3. **Payment System Gaps**  
   - *Impact*: PaymentManager exists, but refund/dispute flows, idempotency, and full gateway support are incomplete.  
   - *Severity*: High – financial risk and compliance exposure.

4. **Tier-Based Navigation and Access**  
   - *Impact*: No direct evidence of Navigation Compose enforcing tier/role-based start destinations or guards (RIONavigation.kt missing).  
   - *Severity*: High – security and UX risk.

5. **Testing Coverage and CI/CD**  
   - *Impact*: Test coverage is below 80% in several modules; E2E and rural simulation tests are not fully automated in CI.  
   - *Severity*: High – reliability and field-readiness risk.

## Section C: Risk & Priority Fixes

**Critical Gaps Blocking Field Test:**
1. Module re-enablement and build stability (Owner: Lead Dev, 1 week)
2. Payment verification, refund, and idempotency (Owner: Payment Team, 2 weeks)
3. Tier-based navigation and access enforcement (Owner: App Team, 1 week)
4. Test coverage and E2E/rural simulation (Owner: QA, 2 weeks)
5. DI/Hilt re-enablement and scoping (Owner: All teams, 1 week)

---

## Section D: Suggested Report Updates

- Clarify which modules are currently disabled and why.
- Note partial compliance for RBI/GDPR and App Check.
- Update performance claims to reflect lack of measured evidence.
- Specify that navigation tier enforcement is not yet implemented in UI.

---

## Section E: Appendices

- **Module Map**: See `settings.gradle.kts` for all modules; only a subset enabled.
- **Dependency Graph**: Compose, Hilt, Room, Firebase, Retrofit, Coil, etc.
- **DB Schema Diff**: See `RIOLocalDatabase.kt` and `firestore-schema.md` for entity/collection mapping.
- **Rules Summary**: `firestore.rules` enforces tier-based access; see `custom-claims-structure.md` for claims.

---

**Checklist for PR Comments:**
- [ ] All modules enabled and buildable
- [ ] DI/Hilt working in all modules
- [ ] Payment system fully verified and idempotent
- [ ] Tier-based navigation enforced in UI
- [ ] 80%+ test coverage and rural/E2E tests automated
- [ ] App Check/Play Integrity enabled and documented
