# RIO Platform App Store Deployment Strategy

## Overview
Comprehensive deployment strategy for launching the RIO rooster community platform on Google Play Store, targeting rural farmers in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana with a phased rollout approach.

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Critical Risks
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Google Play rejection | High | Medium | Pre-submission compliance audit, policy review |
| Network connectivity issues | High | High | Robust offline mode, progressive sync |
| Low user adoption | High | Medium | Extensive beta testing, farmer feedback integration |
| Payment system failures | High | Low | Multiple payment gateways, fallback mechanisms |
| Localization issues | Medium | Medium | Native speaker testing, cultural validation |

### Contingency Plans
- **Phase failure**: If any phase doesn't meet 70% of targets, extend by 2 weeks with focused improvements
- **Technical issues**: 24/7 support team during launch weeks
- **Compliance issues**: Legal team on standby for immediate resolution

## Pre-Launch Preparation

# Step 2: Configure app/build.gradle
android {
    signingConfigs {
        release {
            storeFile file('../rio-upload-key.keystore')
            storePassword System.getenv("KEYSTORE_PASSWORD")
            keyAlias 'rio-upload'
            keyPassword System.getenv("KEY_PASSWORD")
        }
    }
    buildTypes {
        release {
            signingConfig signingConfigs.release
