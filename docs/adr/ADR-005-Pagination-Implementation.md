# ADR-005: Pagination Implementation for Fowl Records

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The ROSTRY platform needs to handle large datasets efficiently, especially for fowl timeline records. As farmers track their fowls over time, the number of records can grow significantly, potentially impacting performance and memory usage on low-end devices in rural areas.

Without pagination, loading all records at once could lead to:
1. Slow UI rendering
2. High memory consumption
3. Poor user experience on low-end devices
4. Network bandwidth issues when syncing with the cloud

We need to implement pagination to ensure smooth performance and a good user experience.

## Decision

We will implement pagination for fowl records with the following approach:

1. **Database Layer**:
   - Add pagination support to FowlRecordDao with LIMIT and OFFSET queries
   - Maintain proper indexing on (fowl_id, record_date DESC) for efficient pagination

2. **Repository Layer**:
   - Add `getRecordsByFowlIdPaged` method to FowlRecordRepository
   - Implement the method in FowlRecordRepositoryImpl with proper error handling

3. **ViewModel Layer**:
   - Add pagination state management in SimpleFowlViewModel
   - Implement `loadMoreRecords` method to fetch additional records
   - Track current page and whether all records have been loaded

4. **UI Layer**:
   - Use LazyColumn in FowlDetailScreen for efficient item rendering
   - Implement infinite scrolling by detecting when the user is near the end of the list
   - Show visual indicators when loading more records

5. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Use a page size of 20 records to balance performance and user experience
   - Load more records when the user is within 5 items of the end of the list
   - Maintain a smooth scrolling experience on low-end devices

## Consequences

### Positive

1. Improved performance when displaying large timelines
2. Reduced memory consumption on low-end devices
3. Better user experience with infinite scrolling
4. Efficient database queries with proper LIMIT and OFFSET usage
5. Reduced network bandwidth usage when syncing with the cloud

### Negative

1. Increased complexity in state management
2. Additional code to maintain
3. Need for proper testing of pagination logic

### Neutral

1. Follows existing patterns in the codebase
2. Maintains consistency with offline-first approach

## Implementation Plan

1. Update FowlRecordDao with pagination methods
2. Update FowlRecordRepository with pagination methods
3. Implement pagination in FowlRecordRepositoryImpl
4. Add pagination state management in SimpleFowlViewModel
5. Implement infinite scrolling in FowlDetailScreen
6. Test pagination functionality
7. Update documentation
