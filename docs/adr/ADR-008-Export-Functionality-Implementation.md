# ADR-008: Export Functionality Implementation for Fowl Records

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The ROSTRY platform tracks important events in a fowl's life through detailed timeline records. Farmers and breeders need to share this information with potential buyers, veterinarians, or agricultural officials outside the app. Currently, there is no mechanism to export or share this information, which limits the platform's utility for trust-building and verification purposes.

Key requirements include:
1. Ability to export fowl timeline information for external sharing
2. Support for multiple formats (text, HTML)
3. Privacy considerations (not sharing actual proof images)
4. Integration with standard Android sharing mechanisms
5. Offline capability for export generation

## Decision

We will implement an export functionality with the following approach:

1. **Export Formats**:
   - Plain text format for simple sharing and wide compatibility
   - HTML format with basic styling for better presentation
   - Both formats will include fowl information and timeline records

2. **Data Included**:
   - Fowl basic information (name, breed, generation, DOB)
   - Timeline records (date, type, description, proof count)
   - Export timestamp and platform identification
   - No actual proof images or sensitive data

3. **Privacy and Security**:
   - Do not include actual proof images in exports
   - Only include proof count as metadata
   - Use Android FileProvider for secure file sharing
   - Generate files in app-private cache directory

4. **Sharing Integration**:
   - Implement standard Android sharing intents
   - Support for sharing via email, messaging apps, etc.
   - Proper MIME type handling for different export formats

5. **Implementation Details**:
   - Create FowlTimelineExporter utility class
   - Use FileWriter for efficient file generation
   - Implement proper error handling and null safety
   - Follow Android best practices for file sharing

6. **User Experience**:
   - Provide clear indication of export progress
   - Handle export failures gracefully
   - Support for both automatic sharing and manual file access

## Consequences

### Positive

1. Enhanced trust-building capabilities with external parties
2. Better verification processes for fowl history
3. Improved utility for farmers in sales and documentation
4. Standard sharing mechanisms for wide compatibility
5. Offline capability for export generation
6. Multiple format support for different use cases

### Negative

1. Increased complexity in data handling
2. Additional storage usage for temporary export files
3. Need for proper cleanup of temporary files
4. Additional code to maintain

### Neutral

1. Follows existing patterns in the codebase
2. Maintains consistency with offline-first approach
3. Provides flexibility for future format additions

## Implementation Plan

1. Create FowlTimelineExporter utility class
2. Implement text format export functionality
3. Implement HTML format export functionality
4. Add sharing integration with Android intents
5. Test export functionality with various data sets
6. Implement proper error handling and edge cases
7. Add documentation and usage examples
8. Integrate with UI components for user access
