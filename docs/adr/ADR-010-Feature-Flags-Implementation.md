# ADR-010: Feature Flags Implementation

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The ROSTRY platform needs a mechanism to enable or disable features remotely for gradual rollouts, A/B testing, and emergency kill switches. This is especially important as we prepare for the pilot launch of the Fowl Records feature and want to be able to quickly disable problematic components if needed.

Key requirements include:
1. Ability to remotely enable/disable features
2. Emergency kill switches for critical components (UploadProofWorker, export sharing)
3. Gradual rollouts for new features
4. A/B testing capabilities
5. Offline support for feature flag states
6. Minimal performance impact

## Decision

We will implement a feature flag system using Firebase Remote Config with the following approach:

1. **Feature Flag Definition**:
   - Create a [FeatureFlags](file:///C:/Users/rowdy/AndroidStudioProjects/RIX/core/common/src/main/java/com/rio/rostry/core/common/config/FeatureFlags.kt#L1-L26) object to define all feature flags
   - Define clear, descriptive flag names
   - Set sensible default values for each flag

2. **Feature Flag Manager**:
   - Create [FeatureFlagManager](file:///C:/Users/rowdy/AndroidStudioProjects/RIX/core/common/src/main/java/com/rio/rostry/core/common/config/FeatureFlagManager.kt#L13-L125) to handle remote configuration
   - Implement fetch and activate mechanisms
   - Provide typed access methods for different flag types
   - Implement force refresh capabilities for development/debugging

3. **Firebase Remote Config Integration**:
   - Use Firebase Remote Config as the backend
   - Set appropriate fetch intervals (1 hour in production)
   - Define default values for offline/first-run scenarios
   - Implement error handling for network failures

4. **Feature Flags for Fowl Records**:
   - `fowl_records_enabled`: Enable/disable the entire Fowl Records feature
   - `upload_proof_worker_enabled`: Enable/disable the UploadProofWorker
   - `export_sharing_enabled`: Enable/disable export sharing functionality
   - `thumbnail_caching_enabled`: Enable/disable thumbnail caching
   - `cover_thumbnails_enabled`: Enable/disable cover thumbnails
   - `smart_suggestions_enabled`: Enable/disable smart suggestions in Add Record screen

5. **Integration Points**:
   - Check feature flags before executing critical operations
   - Use feature flags in UI to show/hide components
   - Implement kill switches for emergency situations
   - Provide user-facing controls where appropriate

## Consequences

### Positive

1. Enables gradual rollouts of new features
2. Provides emergency kill switches for problematic components
3. Supports A/B testing capabilities
4. Allows remote configuration without app updates
5. Improves user experience by hiding incomplete features
6. Reduces support burden by enabling quick fixes

### Negative

1. Increased complexity in feature implementation
2. Additional network requests for flag updates
3. Need for proper default values for offline scenarios
4. Additional code to maintain

### Neutral

1. Follows industry best practices for feature management
2. Integrates well with existing Firebase infrastructure
3. Provides flexibility for future enhancements

## Implementation Plan

1. Create FeatureFlags object with flag definitions
2. Implement FeatureFlagManager with Firebase Remote Config integration
3. Add feature flag checks to critical components
4. Implement UI controls where appropriate
5. Test feature flag behavior in various scenarios
6. Document feature flags for operations team
7. Update README with feature flag documentation
