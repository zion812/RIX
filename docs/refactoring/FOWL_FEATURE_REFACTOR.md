# Fowl Feature Refactor and Completion

**Date:** 2025-08-14

## 1. Summary

This document outlines the audit, refactoring, and feature completion work performed on the Fowl feature module (`:features:fowl`) and its related data pipeline components. The initial task was to verify if the feature's data "fetchers" were "fully developed." The audit revealed significant architectural issues, which were subsequently fixed, and missing UI functionality was implemented.

## 2. Initial Audit Findings

A deep, end-to-end manual code audit of the Fowl feature revealed that it was not in a production-ready state. The key issues were:

1.  **Architectural Duality:** The project contained two database modules, `:core:database-simple` and `:core:database`. The Fowl feature was using the "simple" implementation, while the more advanced, production-grade "database" module was unused.
2.  **Bypassed Repository Layer:** The `SimpleFowlViewModel` was not using the `FowlRepository`. It was communicating directly with the DAO, which violated the project's architecture and bypassed the offline-first logic contained in the repository.
3.  **Inconsistent Dependency Injection:** The ViewModel and UI were manually instantiating their own dependencies, contrary to the project's use of Hilt for DI.
4.  **Incomplete UI:** The main Fowl management screen had non-functional "View Details" and "Edit" buttons, with the implementation marked as `TODO`.

## 3. Implementation and Refactoring Steps

To address the audit findings, the following actions were taken:

1.  **Database Consolidation:** The redundant `:core:database-simple` module was deleted to resolve the architectural conflict. All dependencies were updated to point to the advanced `:core:database` module.
2.  **Data Pipeline Refactoring:**
    *   The `FowlRepository` was refactored to use the advanced `FowlDao` and `FowlEntity` from `:core:database`.
    *   The `FowlViewModel` was refactored to be a proper `@HiltViewModel`, to correctly inject and use the `FowlRepository`, and to remove all direct DAO/database dependencies.
3.  **UI Refactoring and Completion:**
    *   The `SimpleFowlManagementScreen` was updated to use the Hilt-powered ViewModel correctly.
    *   A new `FowlDetailScreen` was created to display the full details of a fowl.
    *   A new `FowlEditScreen` was created to allow users to edit a fowl's details.
4.  **Navigation Implementation:** The application's central navigation graph in `:core:navigation` was updated to include the routes for the new detail and edit screens.
5.  **Unit Test Correction:** The unit test file for the `FowlRepository` was rewritten to correctly test the refactored, production-grade repository.

## 4. Final Status

The Fowl feature is now architecturally sound, functionally complete, and correctly integrated with the project's dependency injection and navigation frameworks. The data pipeline from the UI to the database now follows the intended Repository pattern.
